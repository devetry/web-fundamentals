## Important Note:

### This series of videos uses `MAMP`, `PHPMyAdmin`, and `MySQL`.  **WE ARE NOT USING THESE TOOLS.** Instead we are using `TablePlus` and `Sqlite3`.

## Notes 

In this video lesson we'll expand the functionality of the `register` and `login` handlers we began building in the last lesson. Most of the code we write will be familiar to you by now, but one method we'll introduce is `.first()`. This method allows us to select only the first result in a result set (used in this case when there is only one result in the result set).
