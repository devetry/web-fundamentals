                    <h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>In this studio we'll be using the custom 'postgres-kernel' we set up for jupyter last week instead of myadmin.</p>
<h4 id="a-note-about-mamp">A note about MAMP</h4>
<p>If you prefer, you can use the myadmin instead -- these instructions were originally written for the myadmin which comes with MAMP - if you found MAMP easy to setup you can use those instructions, but its a good idea to note the literal SQL commands that myadmin would be running for you behind the scenes. In production, some places use a GUI like myadmin and others use raw sql, so experiment with both to learn what you like. </p>
<p>For the initial setup, first step is to create a new user account and associated database for our movie-buff project. Then we'll import a <code>.sql</code> file and get the tables we'll use from that. Then we'll perform some queries on that data.</p>
<h3 id="database-setup">Database Setup</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up a new database for this project with a new, associated user account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-createuser.html">Here is the postgres documentation on creating a user</a></p>
<p>Examples are better than documentation though, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6mqk5z2j3pt3pz/Brian%27s%20movie%20db.ipynb?dl=0">here is a jupyter notebook containing examples!</a></p>
<p>A good pattern to follow is that you should have a different user for each application, and the username should match the name of your application. For local development, it's acceptable to use a simple password. Just be sure that you don't use the same password on a production database if you deploy your application!</p>
<h3 id="import-tables-from">Import Tables From <code>.sql</code></h3>
<p>Using syntax similar to the examples, create a database called 'movie-buff'.</p>
<p>Now, download this SQL file: <a href="https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/58d428743111af1d0a20cf28/5b2c4317ae805dcec622b42b/f6db88ddea8d2a9efa34ae2fcdf6200b/movie-buff.postgres.sql">movie-buff.sql</a>.</p>
<p>Open up this file in vscode -- see? SQL is a language like python! (well, not EXACTLY like python, but you can save a file and run it against a database instead of doing everything mannually! neat!)</p>
<p>To run this code in your instance of postgres, run <code>psql -h localhost -U &lt;username you created&gt; -W -d &lt;database you created, probably "movie-buff"&gt; -f path/to/file.sql</code>.</p>
<h4 id="stop-here-and-make-sure-your-setup-looks-ok-play-around-a-bit-if-you-would-like-ask-any-questions">STOP HERE and make sure your setup looks ok. Play around a bit if you would like! Ask any questions.</h4>
<h2 id="studio">Studio</h2>
<p>Sarah has a very eclectic taste in movies, but her friends admire it. Over the years, they've borrowed a lot of her DVDs, and she's set up a database to keep track of who has watched what so that she can make better recommendations for them based on what they've seen so far.</p>
<p>There are four tables in the <code>movie-buff</code> database: <code>movies</code>, <code>directors</code>, <code>viewers</code>, and <code>viewings</code>.</p>
<p>There is one table Sarah made that might not seem intuitive to have created - the 'viewings' table. One way to check out whats going on with this table is to run </p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT
 COLUMN_NAME
FROM
 information_schema.COLUMNS
WHERE
 TABLE_NAME = 'viewings';</code></pre>
<p>The purpose of this table is to keep track of &quot;who watched what when&quot;. The <em>who</em> is the <code>viewer_id</code>, which is a foreign key that references the <code>viewer_id</code> in the <code>viewers</code> table. The <em>what</em> is the <code>movie_id</code> which is a foreign key that references the <code>movie_id</code> in the <code>movies</code> table. And the <em>when</em> is of course the <code>date_viewed</code> column with a <code>date</code> data type. Each viewing of a movie by one of Sarah's friends is captured as a unique record.</p>
<p>This kind of table is very common in relational database design. It has many virtues including that it clearly links the <code>movies</code> and <code>viewers</code> table together and it makes the database more maintainable. For instance, you might have chosen to make a <code>viewing</code> table where you actually list the movie title and the name of the viewer. But if you did that then anytime some of that information changes - say a friend gets married and changes last names - you would now have to update the name of the viewer in <em>both</em> the <code>viewers</code> table <em>and</em> the <code>viewings</code> table. With this design, any updates you make to either the <code>movies</code> or <code>viewers</code> table will be reflected automatically in the results from queries on the <code>viewings</code> table.</p>
<p>Review this lesson from <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/relational-queries-in-sql/a/splitting-data-into-related-tables">Khan Academy</a> for a more in-depth explanation of why we break tables up this way.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any of the tasks below, you can review lessons in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql">Khan Academy</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp">w3schools</a> to get ideas and remind yourself of the proper syntax.</p>
<h3 id="your-task">Your Task:</h3>
<p>Sarah created these tables and inserted all the data into them, but she needs your help to run some queries.
Lets make sure its working -- As an example, say Sarah wants to know the first and last names of any of her friends who borrowed one of her movies before 2010.</p>
<p>We know we'll want to use the <code>viewings</code> table, since that has the dates of when people have viewed her DVDs as well as their ids. And we know we want to use the <code>viewers</code> table since that has the first and last names of her friends. Since we want data from two tables, we know we'll likely need to use a <code>join</code>. We also know that the column in common between the two tables is the <code>viewer_id</code> column, so that will be what we join on. Our SQL statement will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT DISTINCT viewers.first, viewers.last
FROM viewers
JOIN viewings
ON viewers.viewer_id = viewings.viewer_id
WHERE viewings.date_viewed &lt; '2010-01-01'</code></pre>
<p>IF you see data, AWESOME! start helping our imaginary friend below. If you dont see data, <em>STOP HERE</em>. Get some help from a classmate or instructor.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things Sarah needs your help with:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find out which countries the directors in her collection are from (and make sure your result set only lists each country only once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are the French directors in her database?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the date of the first time someone viewed one of Sarah's movies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many movies in her collection were directed by people born in the USA?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the titles of the movies in her collection that were directed by Akira Kurosawa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many times has the movie &quot;Talk to Me&quot; been viewed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was the last time someone viewed one of her movies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the id of the last-viewed movie?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the title of the first movie she loaned to a friend for viewing?</p>
</li>
<li>What is the first and last name of the person who viewed the last-viewed movie?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="bonus-missions">Bonus Missions</h4>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p>Write the SQL query to display the DVDs that others have watched in order of most viewed to least viewed. What's the title of the most-viewed movie(s) in Sarah's collection?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the email of everyone who has watched &quot;The Tango Lesson&quot;, so Sarah can email them and ask what they thought of it.</p>
</li>
