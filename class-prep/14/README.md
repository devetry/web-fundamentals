## Flexbox

Flexbox is a new(er) CSS Module that enables easy `mobile-first` development that allows our applications to look at home in any screen size.  The ability to look good (and adapt) on any screen is called **responsiveness**. A [responsive site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) is one that adapts to different screen sizes, such as desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### A Note on Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a front-end web framework built out of HTML, CSS and Javascript that makes building attractive, polished, and highly functional sites straightforward.

This class previously taught `Bootstrap`, however it is fast becoming an outdated technology.  As such, we will focus our efforts instead learning the much more modern CSS module, `Flexbox`. 

In this lesson, you'll learn a bit about Flexbox. We'll use this knowledge in class to incorporate Flexbox into Flicklist.
